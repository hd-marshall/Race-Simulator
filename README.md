# Race-Simulator

Notes for Development:

    Completed notes:
        - Basic Track DS Completed
            - However creating accurate turns angles to simulate the car at the moment im not sure how it will work
        - Basic Car DS Completed
        - SFML library included
        - Make file completed
        - Add a background in SFML
        - Create the track layout
        - Track points working from the object
        - Using splines ot create the edges between the vertices
        - Move nodes with keyboard

    Current in head thoughts:
        - ReDo code to make all the calls of the track to change the private class
        - create a make track visuals file to make the visual loop simpler
        - Add in a move the nodes with drag feature

    Weaknesses to improve on:
        - learn make files (better)
        - Best loop functions for different data types
