# Race-Simulator

Description:
This race simulation tool is designed to provide users with a realistic experience of racing on a track. It incorporates features such as generating a digital representation of the track, determining the optimal racing line, and simulating tire degradation based on mathematical calculations.

Features:

Track Representation:
The tool generates a digital representation of the track, allowing users to visualize the layout and characteristics of the circuit.

Displaying the Track in a Tool:
The tool provides a graphical interface to display the track, enabling users to interact with it and analyze various aspects such as corners, straights, and elevation changes.

Optimal Racing Line:
Utilizing algorithms and racing principles, the tool calculates the optimal racing line for each corner of the track. This includes determining the ideal braking points, turn-in, apex, and exit points to maximize speed and minimize lap times.

Tire Degradation Modeling:
The tool incorporates mathematical models to simulate tire degradation throughout a race. Factors such as tire compound, track surface, driving style, and environmental conditions are considered to estimate the rate of tire wear and its impact on performance.

Notes for Development:

    fix make file
    adjust main to show the structure of the track

    Implement data structures for representing the track layout.
    Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the track and interact with users.
    Research and implement algorithms for calculating the optimal racing line.
    Integrate mathematical models for simulating tire degradation based on various factors.
    Test the simulation thoroughly to ensure accuracy and realism.
    Document the codebase and provide clear instructions for users on how to use the tool.
